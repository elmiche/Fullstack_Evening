#Write a function that takes two ints, a and b, and returns True if one is positive and the other is negative.


def opposites(a,b):
    if (a*b) < 0:
        return True
   #extra credit??  
    else: 
        return False
print(opposites(1, -4))
#this function has to come after using def to define the funciton.
